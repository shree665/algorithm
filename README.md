# algorithms
An algorithms is a procedure for solving a problem. The term is used in computer science to describe a finite and effective problem
solving method. Algorithms is around the world since 500 BC. Many people believe the word derives from the name of the mathematician, 
Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi, who was part of the royal court in Baghdad and who lived from about 780 to 850.

Most algorithms involve around the data in computation world. This leads to the study of the data structures. The study of algorithms
and data structures go hand on hand. In order to understand the algorithms, we must understand the data structures first. 

The main reason to learn/study algorithms is that it gives us potential on saving time and money. Especially in this computational world,
it is more important than before. As the Artificial Intelligence is growing day by day, we need better and efficient algorithms to process
the huge amount of data in matter of seconds. The ground of algorithms is growing day by day unknowingly. 

It are using very advanced and efficient algorithms every day unknowingly since we have Internet based society.
